### Hello, Iâ€™m **Anastasiia Ivanova**

As far as I remember myself I've always had one million of interests. The idea of whom i want to become as grown up was changing on a daily basis.

Lately I've turned 25 years old and graduated from master, which means there's no time for daydreaming, but a right one to take an action.

I can surely admit that now all my heart and mind belong to Marketing (including digital marketing and UI/UX). The idea of this site.. or blog was born as my portfolio, as one of the things to add in my CV. A place where i can represent my marketing projects. 

As you could guess I'm programming this site in R-studio,on Hugo. I first met R in a class of statistics in university and couldn't imagine that you can program a whole site in it ... that i can program in it!

If you are like me - like to discover new digital things, like marketing or maybe just curuois about the world - stay with me and follow up !

**xxxx,**

**A.**
